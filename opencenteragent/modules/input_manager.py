# Input modules export a number of functions and attributes:
#
# name = <string>
# setup()                       # optional
# teardown()                    # optional
# fetch(blocking=False)         # blocking optional (see below)
# result(transaction, result)   # optional
#
# the "name" attribute is an optional "friendly name" for
# logging purposes.  Default name is derived from file name.
#
# The "setup" function performs whatever initialization is required
# for the module, including such things as background threads
# if necessary for the input module.  Once the setup function is
# called, subsequent calls to the fetch() function should return
# task data as specified below.
#
# Likewise, the "teardown" function performs any necessary cleanup
# and shutdown of the module.  It must return, as shutdown requests
# to the daemon call each input module's teardown functions in series.
#
# The "input" function fetches task data from whatever source is
# appropriate and returns a python dict in this form:
#
# { 'id': ...,            # some unique id for the command
#   'action': '...',      # output handler dispatcher
#   'payload': '...' }    # arbitrary jsonable data for task dispatcher
#
# Note that these are minimum requirements.  Other keys may be
# specified for input module bookkeeping, and will be passed back on a
# result() call.
#
# input plugins receive the data, and mash it into the proper dict
# form, if necessary.  Plugins can thread, although input is
# serialized, and dispatched serially through consumer plugins.
#
# each input plugin will have the setup method called, and a teardown
# method on application stop.  the fetch() method will return the next
# dict available to be processed.
#
# The input plugin will be passed a blocking flag.  Input plugins MAY
# implement a blocking fetch(), but are not required to.  They MUST
# implement a non-blocking fetch, however.  If an input plugin is
# asked to perform a blocking fetch, but does not actually have the
# ability to perform a blocking fetch, it should return and empty
# dict, signifying an inability to perform a blocking fetch.  When
# performing a blocking fetch, then, the plugin MAY NOT return an
# empty dict, but must block until a new dict is ready to be consumed.
#
# The optional "result" function receives the original output dict, as
# well as a "result" dict (as returned from the output plugin).  If
# the plugin has a need to update status, it can do so.
#
# Input plugins can request that the agent quits, by submitting a task of
# the following form:
# { 'id': -1,
#   'action': 'opencenter_agent_quit',
#   'payload': {} }
